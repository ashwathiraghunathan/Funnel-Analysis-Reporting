# Funnel-Analysis-Reporting

A comprehensive analytics project focused on understanding order fluctuations, traffic changes, and conversion-funnel performance for a food-delivery platform. This project includes identifying weekly highs/lows in orders, diagnosing root causes behind fluctuations, and validating hypotheses using supporting operational data.

📁 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to generate weekly funnel insights that explain spikes and drops in orders by analyzing:

Daily orders & traffic

Funnel performance across five stages (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O)

Channel-wise traffic patterns

Operational factors such as discounts, delivery charges, cost for two, payment success rate, and out-of-stock items

This project follows a structured data-analytics workflow using Excel, combining traffic metrics, funnel breakdowns, and supporting business data to create a consolidated insight report.

🎯 Key Responsibilities
✔️ 1. Weekly Order Movement Analysis

Compared daily orders with the same weekday of the previous week, highlighting meaningful changes (>|20%| thresholds).

Detected abnormal fluctuations while accounting for natural weekend lifts.

✔️ 2. Funnel Breakdown & Diagnosis

Calculated funnel metrics including:

L2M — Listing to Menu

M2C — Menu to Cart

C2P — Cart to Payment

P2O — Payment to Order

Identified stages responsible for major shifts (e.g., low M2C due to high delivery charges).

✔️ 3. Traffic Source Investigation

Analyzed changes in traffic from:

Facebook

Twitter

YouTube

Others

Highlighted dates where traffic surges/drops drove order fluctuations.

✔️ 4. Root-Cause Identification

Used Supporting Data (discounts, delivery charges, cost for two, out-of-stock items, payment success, restaurant availability) to validate hypotheses derived from funnel changes.

🧩 Data Sources
Sheet	Purpose
Session Details	Daily session counts (listing → menu → cart → payments → orders). Used for funnel creation.
Channel-wise Traffic	Breaks down traffic by marketing channel to identify traffic-driven shifts.
Supporting Data	Key business metrics to validate conversion fluctuation reasons.
📈 Insights Summary (Sample)

The workbook and report include a date-wise table of highs/lows. Examples:

Date	Change %	Insight

10-01-2019	-45%	Sharp drop due to fall in traffic from online sources (95% drop FB, 49% drop Twitter & YouTube).

22-01-2019	+85%	Surge due to 77% & 747% increase in Facebook/Twitter traffic.

05-02-2019	+115%	Lift caused by higher conversion rates.

04-04-2019	-52%	Low M2C due to high average discounts.

14-09-2019	-57%	M2C drop driven by high average delivery charges & out-of-stock items.
